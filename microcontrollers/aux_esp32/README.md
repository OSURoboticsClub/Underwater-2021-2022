### Notes

while dockerfile is included in this folder, it's not been tested. Recommended to follow standard [ESP IDF Docker guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-docker-image.html), mainly `docker run --rm -v $PWD:/project -w /project espressif/idf idf.py build`
